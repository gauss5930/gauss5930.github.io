## Search on Sorted Data

Search on Sorted Data (SOSD) is a new benchmark that allows researchers
to compare their new (learned) index structures on both synthetic and real-world datasets. It is provided 
as C++ open source code that incurs little overhead (8 instructions and 1 cache miss per lookup), comes 
with diverse synthetic and real-world datasets, and provides efficient baseline implementations. 
Here we provide an interface and leaderboard for index structures on our own hosted SOSD benchmark.

You can clone the [original repository](https://github.com/learnedsystems/SOSD) here to run benchmarks on your own 
machine. This dataset is distributed under the [GPL 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) License.

To have a new learned index added to the benchmark and leaderboard, send an email to [Andreas Kipf](mailto:kipf@mit.edu) or
[Ryan Marcus](mailto:rcmarcus@mit.edu) with the manuscript and repository of the index.
